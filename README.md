# College-Network-Design
This project involves designing a **simulated network infrastructure** for an engineering college using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network ensures secure, efficient, and scalable communication across various departments and administrative units.

## ✅ Features

- 📚 **Year-wise LANs**: Separate Local Area Networks (LANs) created for each academic year (1st to 4th Year) to organize traffic and improve manageability.
- 🛡️ **Dedicated Admin LAN**: A secure and isolated LAN for college administrative staff to ensure sensitive data is protected.
- 🌐 **Efficient Routing**: Implemented appropriate **IP addressing schemes** and **dynamic routing protocols** to ensure optimized communication between LANs.
- 🔒 **Secure Communication**: Used access control strategies and proper subnetting to limit unauthorized access.
- 📈 **Scalability**: Designed with future growth in mind, allowing easy integration of additional departments or users without overhauling the entire network.
